# Project Title:
Memory Design in Verilog: Single-Port RAM and ROM

# Project Overview:
This project demonstrates the implementation of memory modules—Single-Port RAM and ROM—in Verilog HDL. These modules are essential for building digital systems, as RAM provides read/write capabilities while ROM stores predefined data for read-only access.

# Highlights of the Project:
# 1.  RAM -
    -Single Port RAM:
    A basic 8-bit RAM with a total of 64 memory locations, supporting single read and write operations using a single address line.
    
    -Dual Port RAM:
    An advanced 8-bit RAM that allows simultaneous read and write operations on two separate ports, making it ideal for complex digital designs that require concurrent access to memory.

# 2. ROM - 


Testbenches: Comprehensive testbenches simulate and verify the functionality of both RAM and ROM modules.
Waveform Analysis: The project includes sample waveform files to help visualize the operation of memory modules.
