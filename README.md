# Verilog-Based-RAM-and-ROM-Memory-Design
# Project Title:
Memory Design in Verilog: Single-Port and Dual Port RAM and ROM

# Project Overview:
This project demonstrates the implementation of memory modules—Single-Port RAM and ROM—in Verilog HDL. These modules are essential for building digital systems, as RAM provides read/write capabilities while ROM stores predefined data for read-only access.

# Highlights of the Project:
# 1.  RAM -
-Single Port RAM:
    A basic 8-bit RAM with a total of 64 memory locations, supporting single read and write operations using a single address line.
    
-Dual Port RAM:
    An advanced 8-bit RAM that allows simultaneous read and write operations on two separate ports, making it ideal for complex digital designs that require concurrent access to memory.

# 2. ROM - 
1. It refers to computer memory chips containing permanent or semi-permanent data.
2. Unlike RAM, ROM is non-volatile; even after you turn off your computer, the contents of ROM will remain.
3. Almost every computer comes with a small amount of ROM containing the boot firmware.



# Single Port RAM:
A basic 8-bit RAM with a total of 64 memory locations, supporting single read and write operations using a single address line.
