# Verilog-Based-RAM-and-ROM-Memory-Design
# Project Title:
Memory Design in Verilog: Single-Port RAM and ROM

# Project Overview:
This project demonstrates the implementation of memory modules—Single-Port RAM and ROM—in Verilog HDL. These modules are essential for building digital systems, as RAM provides read/write capabilities while ROM stores predefined data for read-only access.

# Highlights of the Project:
1. Single-Port RAM: A basic synchronous memory block with separate data input and output ports but a single address line for read and write operations.
2. ROM: A simple read-only memory block preloaded with example data to showcase its usage.


Testbenches: Comprehensive testbenches simulate and verify the functionality of both RAM and ROM modules.
Waveform Analysis: The project includes sample waveform files to help visualize the operation of memory modules.
